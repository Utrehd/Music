(It’s alright) It’s alright
You’ve got fire
But you’re not still a fighter
My friend It’s alright (It’s alright)
It's alright
If you plunder
They try to take you under

And you
Everyday just fear the fight
Now it’s time to join the riot!

Yo-Ho, so here we go
Don’t wait for another big hero
Outlaws and bastards out of jail
As revenge for every wale
Let’s stand up for truth
Bondage or freedom, you have to choose
Yo-ho, don’t avoid the fight
You have to join the riot!

Join the riot!

(It’s alright) It’s alright
Stand together
Fight this fight forever
My friend It’s all right (It’s alright)
We’re the saviors
Don’t care about behaviour

And you
Everyday just fear the fight
Now it’s time to join the riot!

Yo-Ho, so here we go
Don’t wait for another big hero
Outlaws and bastards out of jail
As revenge for every wale
Let’s stand up for truth
Bondage or freedom, you have to choose
Yo-ho, don’t avoid the fight
You have to join the riot!

Join the riot!

And you
Everyday just fear the fight
Now it’s time to join the riot!

Yo, Yo-Ho, so here we go
Don’t wait for another big hero
Outlaws and bastards out of jail
As revenge for every wale
Let’s stand up for truth
Bondage or freedom, you have to choose
Yo-ho, don’t avoid the fight
You have to join the riot!

Yo-Ho, so here we go
