The Left Flank is Free
Hit him with the knee
Pull down his head
Finish him, break his neck

The bastard wont die
He still crawls around
grab on his blade
shove it down to his throat

Blood covers the floor
he sunks to the ground
the crowd cheers out loud
You'll live an other dayy...  an other dayyy.
